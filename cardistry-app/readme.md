## How to Add New Content

### Flexible Structure

Each item in `itemsData` can include as many or as few sections as needed. Sections are rendered dynamically ‚Äî if a section is missing, it will simply be skipped, or you can add as many new ones as you like. Common sections include:

- `text` ‚Äì general description  
- `setup` ‚Äì preparation instructions  
- `method` ‚Äì step-by-step numbered instructions, optionally with actors  
- `notes` ‚Äì tips, warnings, or extra info  
- `reference` ‚Äì links to videos or tutorials  
- `tags` ‚Äì array of tags for filtering (`"tricks"`, `"games"`, `"shuffles"`, etc.)

Example of an item with multiple sections:

```js
{
  name: "Charlier Cut",
  setup: { title: "The Setup", content: "<p>Hold the deck in mechanics grip before starting the cut.</p>" },
  method: {
    title: "The Method",
    content: `
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Dealer:</strong> Shuffles the deck.</li>
        <li><strong>Spectator:</strong> Selects a card.</li>
        <li><strong>Dealer:</strong> Cuts the deck.</li>
      </ol>`
