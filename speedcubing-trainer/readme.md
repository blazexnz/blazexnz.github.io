# Speedcubing Scrambler App

A lightweight web app to quickly generate scrambles for cube puzzles. You can choose the number of algorithms displayed and remove them from the screen as you use them.

## Features
- **Puzzle Selector:** Choose your puzzle to generate scrambles for (2x2, 3x3, 4x4).  
- **Customisable Number of Algorithms:** Select how many scrambles to display. Default is 5, optimised for iPhone screens. Scrambles are also generated automatically on page load.  
- **Interactive UI:** Click on a scramble to remove it after use.  
- **Compliant Scrambles:** Algorithms follow World Cube Association (WCA) rules.  
- **Cube Orientation Reminder:** Notes to guide proper cube orientation while scrambling.  
- **Algorithms Guide:** Quick link to a CFOP algorithms reference.  
- **WCA-Compliant Rules:** Scrambles adhere to standard WCA rules:
  - No consecutive moves on the same face.  
  - No immediate inverses (e.g., U followed by U’).  
  - Avoid same-face repetition with different modifiers (U then U2, U then U’).  
  - Prevent ABA patterns with opposite faces (e.g., U D U).

## How to Use
1. **Select Your Puzzle:** Choose between 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4. 3x3 is the default.  
2. **Set Number of Algorithms:** Enter how many scrambles you want to display.  
3. **Generate Scrambles:** Click the "Generate" button to create your scrambles.  
4. **Click a Scramble to Remove:** Remove scrambles from the screen after use by clicking on them, pressing space, or pressing enter
