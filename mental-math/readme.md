## Difficulty Levels Explained

- **Level 1:** The "primary" number in a problem is a single-digit number (1–9). The second number can range from 1–3 digits. Ideal for beginners or quick warm-up drills.  
- **Level 2:** The primary number is double-digit (10–99), with the second number still ranging from 1–3 digits. This increases the complexity and encourages mental calculation skills.  
- **Level 3:** The primary number is triple-digit (100–999), paired with a 1–3 digit number. Suitable for advanced users who want challenging problems to strengthen mental math speed and accuracy.  

## Notes

- In **Continuous Tap** mode, clicks on inputs or control buttons are ignored, so you can tap anywhere else on the screen to generate the next problem.  
- Running total can be hidden or shown with the **Hide/Show Total** button.
