# Language Practice App

This is a simple web app designed to help you practice converting numbers between different languages, particularly for Vietnamese and Tagalog. The app generates random numbers, one at a time, and allows you to practice their written forms in either language. You get real-time feedback on your answers, and the app automatically progresses with a correct answer.

## Features
- **Random number generation:** The app generates random numbers within a specified range.
- **Language modes:** Toggle between **Vietnamese** and **Tagalog** language modes for number translations.
- **Conversion modes:** Toggle between **Base to Target** (number to word) and **Target to Base** (word to number) modes.
- **Real-time feedback:** Get real-time feedback on your answers, colour coded for correctness (green for correct, red for incorrect).
- **Automatic progression:** Correct answers automatically generate the next number (with a short delay).
- **Progress tracking:** A score counter keeps track of how many answers you've gotten correct.
- **Flexible input:** For Vietnamese, you can input the word in either the Vietnamese alphabet (with diacritics) or the English alphabet (without diacritics).
- **Responsive design:** The app layout is fully responsive, ensuring it works well across different screen sizes, particularly on mobile devices.
